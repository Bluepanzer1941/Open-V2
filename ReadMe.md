Interested in contributing? I am looking for journal articles and books with information on the following:

Economic and demographic data starting from 1820:

This includes, but is not limited to, items such as population distribution, age distribution, employment statistics, consumption and production quantities (both of raw materials and processed goods), wages, market prices of goods, market prices of housing, prices of transportation (rail, sea, and river), interest rates, tariffs, etc.

Military statistics starting from 1820:

Size of armies both at war and at peace, including numbers both of active soldiers and support personnel. Combat statistics, including deaths, casualties, numbers of POWs taken. Statistics of deaths/injuries due to disease and accidents. Total cost of military operations and of peacetime military expenses. Amount of supplies transported and consumed. Amount of small arms ammunition & shells used.

Note on historical sources:

I am not looking for primary sources; it requires historical expertise to account for inaccuracies that I do not possess.

Research on economic simulation:

Articles and monographs on economic simulation focused on general economic simulation rather than simulation of specific phenomena. I am also more interested in research revolving around actual implementations than in purely theoretical work.
